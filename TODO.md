## TODO:
- Fix Python packaging so that kokobot is a legit project and module.
- Add command counters for statistics.
- Add emoji create, delete, list, and search.
- Use S3 API to save uploaded pics and files for notes (maximum file size to be 10 Mb?), and store their links into database.
- Koko: Sanitize string input to have a maximum length.
- Koko: Allow for note chaining up to some number of notes (30 maybe?). BUT, avoid recursion.
